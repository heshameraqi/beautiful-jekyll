title: Distraction Detection Dataset
subtitle: Machine Intelligence Research Group, the American University in Cairo (AUC)
---

This is the first publicly available dataset for distracted driver detection. We had 44 participants from 7 different countries: Egypt (37), Germany (2), USA (1), Canada (1), Uganda (1), Palestine (1), and Morocco (1). Out of all participants, 29 were males and 15 were females. Some drivers participated in more than one recording session with different time of day, driving conditions, and wearing different clothes.
Videos were shot in 5 different cars: Proton Gen2, Mitsubishi Lancer, Nissan Sunny, KIA Carens, and a prototyping car. We extracted 14,478 frames distributed over the following classes: Safe Driving (2,986), Phone Right (1,256), Phone Left (1,320), Text Right (1,718), Text Left (1,124), Adjusting Radio (1,123), Drinking (1,076), Hair or Makeup (1,044), Reaching Behind (1,034), and Talking to Passenger (1,797). The sampling is done manually by inspecting the video files with eye and giving a distraction label for each frame. The transitional actions between each consecutive distraction types are manually removed. The figure below shows samples for the ten classes in our dataset.

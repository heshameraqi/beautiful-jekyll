Implementing collision avoidance mechanism in automated guided vehicles (AGV) using Evolutionary Neural Networks. The network first learns the weights in a simulated environment in Gazebo simulator, then the weights are transferred to the AGV network which continues to improve the learned weights in the real environment.
